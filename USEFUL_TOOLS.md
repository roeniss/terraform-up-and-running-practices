- `tflint` : Slightly different from `terraform validate`. So why not?
- `checkov` : Static checker for security issues
- `tfsec` : security check. seems advanced than checkov.. i guess?
- `terraform-docs` : See result from [README.md](./README.md)
- `infracost` : Useful. Until run this, I didn't know that terraform aws_launch_configuration enable "ec2 detailed monitoring" by default
- `terraform validate github action` : good. maybe atlantis is a little bit better?
- `inframap` : Not useful actually, because I'm not sure which one is "important" or not.

- `act` : local github action testing tool. Would be better if my laptop is faster than now...

- `terrastate` : vscode ext, not checked but looks good.
